OPTESS
============

_The development of this toolbox is still in early stage. It is not intended
for productive use at the moment._

OPTESS is a framework around a (MI)LP Optimization to dimension an energy
storage system or hybrid energy storage system. It builds the model with the
help of pyomo and provides routines and classes for pre- and postprocessing.
Exemplarily, the toolbox can take a load profile of a factory and calculate
minimal storage (regarding energy, for a fixed power) to perform a specified
power cut. Or, it can take the load profile of a photo voltaik plant with some
consumers in a microgrid and calculate minimal storage to achieve a certain
throughput and self consumption rate. The model assumes an idealised storage
subject to efficiency and self discharge losses and not specific storage
technologies with a fixed power to energy ratio.

Requirements
------------

Python 3.4 or later

Additional Python Packages:
- pyomo
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- overload


Installation
------------

_Information below is outdated._

Download source code and install via `pip install .` or install directly from
pypi.org servers via `pip install optess`. Note, that the last one might be an
outdated version.


Getting Started
---------------

_Information below is outdated._

Program flow is centered around two main classes, `OptimizeSingleEES` and
`OptimizeHybridEES`, depending on whether a single energy storage shall be
optimized or a hybrid energy storage (The latter one does not work at the
moment). These classes gather inputs, delegate calculation and gather outputs,
or in other words, administrate the whole calculation process with pre- and
postprocessing.

An optimization setting is defined by:
- a load profile (`class Signal`)
- one or two storages (`class Storage`)
- an optimization aim (`class Objective`)
- in case of HESS: a strategy or boundary for control (`class Strategy`)
- A solver (`class Solver`)

For all inputs, factories are prepared to easily get started.

```python
    import factories

    signal = factories.datafactory('alt')
    storage = factories.storagefactory('2.low')
    objective = factories.objectivefactory('std0-3')
    solver = 'glpk'
```

Then, the optimization object can be initialized:

```python
    from optimize_ess import OptimizeSingleESS

    optim = OptimizeSingleESS(signal, storage, objective, solver)
```

To get the results, simply call it as a property

```python
    res = optim.results
```

An alternative way to set up an optimization is the usage of a factory for the
complete setting:

```python
    opt_setup = factories.singlesetupfactory('alt.low', '2')
```

Which returns a tuple which can be directly unpacked into `OptimizeSingleESS`:

```python
    optim = OptimizeSingleESS(*opt_setup)
```

All objects provide `pprint()` and `pplot()` functions to easily analzye,
visualize and show the different objects, e.g.

```python
    optim.pplot()
    optim.signal.pprint()
    optim.results.pplot()
```


Known Issues
------------

_Information below is outdated._

Hybrid EES Optimization is virtually useless at the moment as the model is
erroneous.
